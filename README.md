# EZCoreLocation

Just a little demo project for playing with CoreLocation and exploring the different things we could possibly do with it. Pretty basic stuff, minimal testing (again just for demoing).

The crux of the logic exists in `Location` which is a wrapper around `CLLocation` and the manager, which acts as the delegate and provides various functionality for updates to the device location (`EZCoreLocation` class).
